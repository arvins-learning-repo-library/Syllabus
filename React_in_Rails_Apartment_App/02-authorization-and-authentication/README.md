We start off with a discussion of a few concepts around authentication and authorization.  It's important to make the distinction clearly.

## Start Here
* [Authentication vs. Authorization](./01-authentication-vs-authorization.md) (independent reading)
* [Authentication](./02-authentication.md) (independent reading)

## Devise
We turn our attention to a base install of Devise, a popular Rails authentication gem, and explore how Devise works in an app that doesn't use React.

## Devise and a Single Page App

#### Group Work
This example, meant to be done as a group exercise brings all the concepts together.  We build an app with authenticated Devise routes, and a single page application.
