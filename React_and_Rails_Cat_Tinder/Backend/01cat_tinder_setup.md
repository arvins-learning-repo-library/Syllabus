# Creating Your Own API
We've looked at connecting React apps to an external API, and seen how to use data from an API to build compelling front end applications.  Today we're going to build our own API that will serve the data we create to our front end. 

Creating our own API opens up a new world of possibilities for building engaging, interactive applications.  We can begin to accept user input, store and manipulate that input in the backend, and then provide a personalized experience for our user, perfectly suited to the task he/she is trying to achieve.

As you've seen, the primary tool to collect input from users is an HTML form.  The user fills in form fields with information that allows them to interact with the application.  As a general rule, we always want to process, validate, and store user data on the server where we have more control and processing power to handle it.  To do so, we need to build an API that the React app can both send data to and receive data from.  Ruby on Rails is a fantastic platform to build just such an API, and is what we'll use in class.  There are many other options for building back end APIs.

In the architecture we are building, our front and backend will be two separate applications, giving us more freedom to choose the tools and technologies we want.  Throughout your career as a developer, you'll interact with many other backend platforms.  APIs can be built using Ruby, PHP, Python, Java, and even Javascript, among many others.  That might seem overwhelming, but remember that the concepts are generally the same no matter what technology is used.  The server is where we process data sent by the frontend, clean and store that data, and serve updated data back to the front end app to be consumed by the user.

## Building an API for Cat Tinder
We're going to build an application to help our users' cats socialize and be well adjusted members of the feline community.  Our application will allow users to create profiles for their cats, search other cat profiles and setup kitty play dates.  In this module we're focusing on the server side, so let's jump in and start building an application.

## Overview of goals
* Setting up a Ruby on Rails API application
* Creating endpoints to accept and serve data
* Validating user input

# App setup
By the end of this section, you'll have a Rails app setup as an API with one test route.  You'll be able to receive JSON requests, and respond with data encoded in JSON format.

## Let's get started
We're going to use the ```--api``` flag when building a new Rails application to customize our new Rails app to have just what we need.  The app communicates in JSON, instead of HTML/CSS/Javascript, so we don't need to clutter the app up with support for all of those file types.  Open up a command line prompt, and enter the following commands:

```
$ gem install rails
$ rails new cat_tinder -T --database=postgresql
$ cd cat_tinder
$ rails db:create
```
This gets the latest and greatest version of Rails, and generates a new Rails application configured to be used as an API.  the ```-T``` flag tells rails to skip adding the default Minitest framework, as we're going to use Rspec instead.

```bash
$ echo "gem 'rspec-rails', groups: [:development, :test]" >> Gemfile
$ bundle install
$ rails generate rspec:install
```

This adds 'rspec-rails' to the Gemfile, and instructs Rails to only load rspec when we are in development or test mode, and not production.  The ```rails g rspec:install``` command installs all the necessary files to create and run our tests.

Next its time to add a Cat resource.  The following command will add the Model, Migration, Controller, and Route for cats.

```bash
$ rails g resource cat name:string age:integer enjoys:text
$ rails db:migrate
````

## Verify that we're all set up
Let's take a look around the application and verify that everything is setup correctly.  The first thing we can do is see that our test suite is running.  Of course, we don't have any specs yet, so we won't get much feedback, but rspec itself should run and finish successfully:

```
$ rspec spec
*

Pending: (Failures listed here are expected and do not affect your suite's status)

  1) Cat add some examples to (or delete) .../cat_tinder/spec/models/cat_spec.rb
     # Not yet implemented
     # ./spec/models/cat_spec.rb:4


Finished in 0.01159 seconds (files took 2.77 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures, 1 pending
```

Looks good!  If we open up Atom and inspect our app, we should see the following file structure:
![cat tinder files](https://s3.amazonaws.com/learn-site/curriculum/cat-tinder/cat_tinder_server_files.png)

Open up ```db/migrate/``` (yours will be named slightly different)

```Ruby
class CreateCats < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def change
    create_table :cats do |t|
      t.string :name
      t.integer :age
      t.text :enjoys

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

If we look in ``` config/routes.rb ```, we should see our cats route there:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :cats
  # For details on the DSL available within this file, see http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
end
```

With one last check, we can be pretty confident that everything is setup correctly.  Let's fire up a Rails console, and interact with the database:

```
$ rails c
Running via Spring preloader in process 22833
Loading development environment (Rails 5.1.5)
2.4.1 :001 > Cat.create(name: 'Felix', age: 4, enjoys: 'Window ledges, being in charge, and cat food, lots and lots of cat food.')
   (0.1ms)  begin transaction
  SQL (1.3ms)  INSERT INTO "cats" ("name", "age", "enjoys", "created_at", "updated_at") VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)  [["name", "Felix"], ["age", 4], ["enjoys", "Window ledges, being in charge, and cat food, lots and lots of cat food."], ["created_at", "2018-03-09 16:01:41.355922"], ["updated_at", "2018-03-09 16:01:41.355922"]]
   (1.1ms)  commit transaction
 => #<Cat id: 1, name: "Felix", age: 4, enjoys: "Window ledges, being in charge, and cat food, lots...", created_at: "2018-03-09 16:01:41", updated_at: "2018-03-09 16:01:41">
2.4.1 :002 > Cat.all
  Cat Load (0.3ms)  SELECT  "cats".* FROM "cats" LIMIT ?  [["LIMIT", 11]]
 => #<ActiveRecord::Relation [#<Cat id: 1, name: "Felix", age: 4, enjoys: "Window ledges, being in charge, and cat food, lots...", created_at: "2018-03-09 16:01:41", updated_at: "2018-03-09 16:01:41">]>
2.4.1 :003 >
```

That looks great!  In the next step, we'll expose some endpoints in our API, so the frontend application has a way to communicate with all the functionality we've built out so far.
